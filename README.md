# A bucket full of Classical Dynamic Programming Problems

## This repository consists of the solutions to well-known classical dynamic programming questions.

## Idea

Recently only, I started to get my hands dirty on DP problems so came up with an idea of creating a repository as well to which other people can refer to.

------

## Repo structure

```
Language (Say, Python)
│
└───Problem Name (Say, Longest Common Subsequence)
│   |   Approach 1 (Say, naive.py)
│   |   Approach 2 (Say, memoization.py)
│   |       ...   
|   |       ...
|
└───Problem Name (Say, Longest Palindromic Subsequence)
│   |   Approach 1 (Say, naive.py)
│   |   Approach 2 (Say, memoization.py)  
|   |       ...
|   |       ...
|

```
